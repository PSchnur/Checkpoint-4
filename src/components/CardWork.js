          At the end of his studies, at the age of 18, the young Quebecer Guy
          Lalibert√©, looking for a career in the world of show business, left
          home and decided to travel around Europe as a travelling musician.
          There he learns the trade of fire-eater. In 1979 he decided to devote
          himself to the street arts and during the summer of the same year he
          participated in the organization of a popular festival in
          Baie-Saint-Paul with two friends Daniel Gauthier and Gilles
          Sainte-Croix.
